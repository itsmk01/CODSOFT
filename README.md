# CODSOFT
# CodSoft Internship - Python Programming Projects

This repository will contain the projects I am working on during my Python programming internship at CodSoft. The focus is on building a strong foundation in Python by completing simple and basic tasks.

## Key Areas to be Covered

- **Fundamental Python Skills**: Implementing core concepts such as loops, functions, and data structures.
- **Basic Scripting**: Writing small programs for various tasks.
- **Introduction to Libraries**: Exploring Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib for basic data handling and visualization.
- **Project-based Learning**: Developing beginner-level projects that reinforce understanding of Python syntax and logic.

## Projects (Work in Progress)

1. Basic Python programs (loops, functions, conditionals) 
2. Simple data manipulation using Pandas 
3. Basic data visualization with Matplotlib 
4. Automation scripts (e.g., file handling, text processing)

As I complete each project, I will update this repository with the code and relevant documentation. Stay tuned for updates!
